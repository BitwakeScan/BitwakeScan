## 🧠 Core Detection Functions

### 1. 🔎 DeFiWatch — Real-Time DeFi Threat Detection
```python
def defi_watch(defi_data):
    price_change = defi_data["priceChange"]
    market_liquidity = defi_data["marketLiquidity"]
    token_volume = defi_data["tokenVolume"]

    risk_factor = (price_change / market_liquidity) * token_volume
    alert_threshold = 0.5

    if risk_factor > alert_threshold:
        return "Alert: Potential DeFi Threat Detected"
    else:
        return "DeFi Market Stable"
```
#### Description:
DeFiWatch continuously scans token markets and calculates a dynamic risk factor using three key parameters: price change, market liquidity, and token volume. It helps detect anomalies like pump-and-dumps, low-liquidity traps, or sentiment flips. When the score breaches the danger zone, it triggers an instant alert.

### 2. ⚠️ WakeAlert — Token Behavior Analysis
```js
function wakeAlert(tokenData) {
  const fluctuationRatio = Math.abs(tokenData.currentPrice - tokenData.previousPrice) / tokenData.previousPrice;
  const volumeImpact = tokenData.transactionVolume / tokenData.marketLiquidity;

  if (fluctuationRatio > 0.1 && volumeImpact > 0.5) {
    return 'Alert: Token Behavior Out of Normal Range';
  } else {
    return 'Token Behavior Normal';
  }
}
```
#### Description:
WakeAlert flags sudden price movements relative to liquidity. If a token sharply fluctuates during a low-liquidity window, it could indicate manipulation or whale intervention. WakeAlert catches this "off-script" behavior before it becomes visible to the broader market.

### 3. 🕵️ TokenSense — Suspicious Activity Monitoring
```python
def token_sense(token_data):
    price_change = token_data["priceChange"]
    previous_price = token_data["previousPrice"]
    token_volume = token_data["tokenVolume"]
    market_liquidity = token_data["marketLiquidity"]

    price_impact = price_change / previous_price
    volume_ratio = token_volume / market_liquidity

    if abs(price_impact) > 0.2 and volume_ratio > 1:
        return "Alert: Suspicious Token Activity Detected"
    else:
        return "Token Activity Normal"
```
#### Description:
TokenSense examines market behavior for hidden threats like wash trading, bot-driven surges, or stealth deploys. It correlates price impact with abnormal volume to flag tokens operating outside normal bounds.

### 4. 🧠 WalletGuard — Risk Alert System
```js
function walletGuard(walletData) {
  const walletRiskScore = walletData.totalVolume / walletData.activeTokens;
  const alertThreshold = 0.75;

  if (walletRiskScore > alertThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: High-Risk Wallet Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Wallet Activity Normal';
  }
}
```
#### Description:
WalletGuard highlights high-intensity wallets often used in multi-token exploits or low-cap manipulations. It scores wallets based on their transaction volume vs. token diversity, flagging potential sniper or bot wallets early.

### 5. 🛡️ DeFiShield — Multi-Chain Risk Detection
```js
function defiShield(defiData) {
  const multiChainRisk = (defiData.priceVolatility * defiData.totalVolume) / defiData.marketLiquidity;
  const riskThreshold = 1.0;

  if (multiChainRisk > riskThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: Multi-Chain Risk Detected';
  } else {
    return 'DeFi Safe';
  }
}
```
#### Description:
DeFiShield is designed to detect threats across chains by analyzing volatility and volume propagation. It’s built to identify synchronized exploits, bridge vulnerabilities, and liquidity-based flashloan risks — before they cascade across networks.
