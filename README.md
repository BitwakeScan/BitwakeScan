# 🛠️ BitwakeScan: Real-Time DeFi Threat Detection

## 🌐 Overview

**BitwakeScan** is a live monitoring tool for DeFi ecosystems.  
It detects unusual activity across tokens, wallets, and chains — alerting you to threats before they spread.  
With AI-driven precision, Bitwake follows the ripple effects of manipulation, letting you move fast and stay safe.

## 🔑 Key Features

🛡️ **DeFiWatch**  
Scans tokens for real-time threats using live price volatility, volume changes, and liquidity shifts.

⚠️ **WakeAlert**  
Flags abnormal token behavior linked to sudden price spikes, low liquidity traps, or stealth minting.

🧠 **TokenSense**  
Analyzes transactional balance — detects suspicious patterns like wash trading or inorganic volume growth.

🔍 **WalletGuard**  
Tracks wallet behaviors across tokens to highlight actors involved in exploits, farming schemes, or coordinated drains.

🌐 **DeFiShield**  
Monitors cross-chain ecosystems and identifies synchronized attack patterns before they unfold.

## 🗺️ BitwakeScan Roadmap

Bitwake evolves in waves — from foundational monitoring to predictive security.  
Each phase expands its ability to detect, track, and forecast DeFi threats in real time.

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Intelligence *(MVP — Complete)*

Foundational modules are active. BitwakeScan is already helping users monitor DeFi ecosystems and spot early threats.

- 🔎 **DeFiWatch** — Real-time threat detection across DeFi tokens  
- ⚠️ **WakeAlert** — Detects sudden token anomalies and liquidity events  
- 🕵️ **TokenSense** — Flags suspicious transactions and launch behavior  
- 🧠 **WalletGuard** — Alerts tied to risky or exploit-prone wallet activity  
- 🔗 **Access System** — Discord-based role entry + $BWAKE token verification  
- 🧩 **Lab Access Keys** — Role-based unlocking of deeper scan features  
- 🖥️ **Chrome Extension UI** — Streamlined interface for alerts and token scans  
📅 *Released: Q3 2025*

### 🟣 Phase 2: Expanded Detection Layer *(In Progress)*

BitwakeScan expands its awareness — improving accuracy and chain-wide threat coverage.

- 🛡️ **DeFiShield** — Reinforced protection layer for anomaly revalidation  
- 📡 **AlertSync** — Real-time alert system across multiple chains  
- 🧬 **TokenTrack** — Behavioral pattern scanning and timeline correlation  
- 💧 **FlowGuard** — Monitors liquidity drops and high-risk movement  
- 📲 **Tiered Roles** — Unlockable features via modular Discord access  
📅 *Expected: Q4 2025*

### 🔴 Phase 3: Predictive Intelligence *(Planned)*

The next evolution: Bitwake moves from reaction to preemptive threat anticipation.

- 🧠 **AI Pattern Forecasting** — Trained models to detect early threat emergence  
- 🛰️ **Preemptive Threat Recognition** — Flagging risks before they manifest  
- 🔁 **Adaptive Filtering Layers** — Dynamic responses to behavior shifts  
- 🌉 **Cross-Chain Risk Syncing** — Unified threat awareness across ecosystems  
📅 *Target: Q1 2026*

## 🧩 Feature Mechanics & AI Formulas

BitwakeScan is powered by lightweight, interpretable AI modules — each designed to monitor, detect, and forecast threats across DeFi environments.  
Below are the core scanning functions driving real-time analysis and alerting.

### 1. DeFiWatch — Real-Time DeFi Threat Detection

```python
def defi_watch(defi_data):
    price_change = defi_data["priceChange"]
    market_liquidity = defi_data["marketLiquidity"]
    token_volume = defi_data["tokenVolume"]

    risk_factor = (price_change / market_liquidity) * token_volume
    alert_threshold = 0.5

    if risk_factor > alert_threshold:
        return "Alert: Potential DeFi Threat Detected"
    else:
        return "DeFi Market Stable"
```
#### Description: Scans token markets using price change, liquidity, and volume to identify abnormal movements.
Flags pump-and-dumps, liquidity traps, and sudden sentiment flips in real time.

### 2. WakeAlert — Token Behavior Analysis


```javascript
function wakeAlert(tokenData) {
  const fluctuationRatio = Math.abs(tokenData.currentPrice - tokenData.previousPrice) / tokenData.previousPrice;
  const volumeImpact = tokenData.transactionVolume / tokenData.marketLiquidity;

  if (fluctuationRatio > 0.1 && volumeImpact > 0.5) {
    return 'Alert: Token Behavior Out of Normal Range';
  } else {
    return 'Token Behavior Normal';
  }
}
```
#### Description: Focuses on volatility relative to liquidity.
Detects unusual token behavior — useful for identifying stealth manipulation before it becomes visible to the wider market.

### 3. TokenSense — Suspicious Activity Monitoring

```python
def token_sense(token_data):
    price_change = token_data["priceChange"]
    previous_price = token_data["previousPrice"]
    token_volume = token_data["tokenVolume"]
    market_liquidity = token_data["marketLiquidity"]

    price_impact = price_change / previous_price
    volume_ratio = token_volume / market_liquidity

    if abs(price_impact) > 0.2 and volume_ratio > 1:
        return "Alert: Suspicious Token Activity Detected"
    else:
        return "Token Activity Normal"
```
#### Description: Evaluates aggressive price shifts against liquidity depth.
Useful for identifying wash trading, bot behavior, or stealth launches with hidden intent.

### 4. WalletGuard — Risk Alert System

```javascript
function walletGuard(walletData) {
  const walletRiskScore = walletData.totalVolume / walletData.activeTokens;
  const alertThreshold = 0.75;

  if (walletRiskScore > alertThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: High-Risk Wallet Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Wallet Activity Normal';
  }
}
```
#### Description: Detects wallets with exploit-like behavior or abnormal trading patterns.
Flags sniper contracts, whale rotations, or multi-token attackers by analyzing volume and token spread.

### 5. DeFiShield — Multi-Chain Risk Detection

```javascript
function defiShield(defiData) {
  const multiChainRisk = (defiData.priceVolatility * defiData.totalVolume) / defiData.marketLiquidity;
  const riskThreshold = 1.0;

  if (multiChainRisk > riskThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: Multi-Chain Risk Detected';
  } else {
    return 'DeFi Safe';
  }
}
```
#### Description: Designed for cross-chain analysis.
Evaluates tokens deployed across multiple networks for synchronized exploits, flashloan setups, or coordinated rug events.
